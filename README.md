# Comparing All Basic Regression Algorithms
Here I have tried to compare all basic machine learning algorithms for regression and compared performances.
I have implementd the following on boson database from scikit learn:
1) multi variate linear regression
2) multi variate polynomial regression
3) SVM
4) Single tree
5) Random forest
